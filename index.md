# Methodology

This tree survey was carried out over two days at the end of November 2021.  It updates a previous tree survey which was 
conducted during an earlier part of the year in 2012. 
The location of each tree was recorded as OSGL and lat/long using the Grid Location GB iPhone application with a 4G signal under clear weather conditions. 
Girth measurements were taken using a Stanley 30m surveying tape measure in metric units. They have been recorded in centimetres, but given the 
variability in trunk profile amplified by the large girth of the trees, the error margin in the repeatability of these measurements is likely 
to be significantly greater than that level of precision.
The widespread presence of arils underneath female trees at this time of year greatly helped in confirming the sex of each tree.
Tree identity was cross-referenced against the 2012 survey, however the positions did not match up fully. As a result, identity was 
triangulated via the additional use of proximal girth measurements. 
For the same reason, new synthetic identifiers have been assigned to each tree: factors such as weather conditions and GPS signal 
strength variability clearly impact the repeatability of geolocation measurement, so - despite its obvious apparent suitability - in practice geolocation 
does not seem such a good choice for use as a permanent tree identifier.
